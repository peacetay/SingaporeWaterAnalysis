# SingaporeWaterAnalysis

<p>The attainment of water self-sufficiency in Singapore before the expiration of the second Water Agreement in 2061 is a pressing imperative.</p>
<p>Given that total water demand is projected to double by 2060, this project will examine the potential supply-side measures that can increase the supply from the other three water sources, while also taking into account the demand factors that affect potable and non-potable water usage in Singapore.</p>
<p>The present study will delve into Singapore's water requirements and seek answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) What is the extent of the increase in local water supply required to achieve 100% self-sufficiency in water supply by 2060?</p>
<p>(2) Which source of local water supply would be most advantageous for Singapore to augment?</p>
<p>(3) How will water demand evolve by 2060?</p>
